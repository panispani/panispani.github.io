<!-- # `sanitext` – Remove LLM-generated Text Fingerprints -->

## The Hidden Fingerpint

How many differences can you spot between these two?

```
- I'm AI.            (Normal text)
− І’m󠅘󠅟󠅜󠅑 ΑІ.󠅓󠅙󠅑󠅟            (AI-tainted text)
```

You probably noticed that the second quote looks a bit different? Actually, every single character in the second string is \"tainted\" in some way!

- `−` (U+2212) is a minus sign instead of a hyphen
- ` ` (U+2009) is thin space
- `І` (U+406) is a cyrillic letter instead of the latin "I"
- `’` (U+2019) is a right single quoation mark instead of a regular quote [^1]
- `m󠅘󠅟󠅜󠅑` is the letter 'm' followed by hidden variation selectors, which encode the message \"hola\" (more info [here](https://paulbutler.org/2025/smuggling-arbitrary-data-through-an-emoji/))
- ` ` (U+2009) is thin space
- `Α` (U+391) is a greek letter
- `І` (U+406) is cyrillic
- `.󠅓󠅙󠅑󠅟` is the period '.' with the encoded message \"ciao\" using variation selectors

You'd never notice these with the naked eye, but they could be used to detect AI-generated text.

Which raises the question: if you mostly need an LLM to generate **ASCII** (code, emails, ..), why allow unnecessary Unicode? And if you do need specific Unicode characters, why not just **explicitly define** which ones?

[^1]: The right single quotation mark `’`, while unusual on US keyboards, is automatically used to replace single quotes on iPhones if **Smart Punctuation** is enabled. However, I suspect that many of the long LinkedIn posts I notice this in weren't written on an iPhone :)

**Will Paste Special (Cmd+Shift+V) Fix This?**
In some apps, \"Paste Special\" strips formatting and replaces fancy typography with plain ASCII. But it **won't always remove invisible characters or homoglyphs**. For example, I tried **Paste Special** in Sublime Text, and nothing was removed—but the thin space (U+2009) was clearly visible.

### **Why I Built This**

This isn't a claim that major LLMs do all (or any) of these tricks. That said, I started working on this because I **accidentally** discovered an instance of text fingerprinting while debugging a byte-sensitive bug. That's when I realized: it's time to say goodbye to (at least these kinds of) fingerprints for good. 🙂

Even if the LLM itself doesn't add these, a wrapper around it might. This tool is for anyone who wants **clean, reliable text**, free from invisible garbage hiding inside.

## **Zooming out: Watermarks & Fingerprints**

AI-generated content, in general, can be _marked_, sometimes invisibly, to identify its origin. A few examples:

- **Latent Space Fingerprints** - AI models leave behind subtle statistical patterns. Their text generation follows a probability distribution, creating a kind of **stochastic signature** (e.g., by occasionally using certain rare words).

- **Watermarking** – Models can sneak in patterns in text, images, or audio. Think of it as an AI signature, hidden but detectable.

- **Metadata Encoding** – Some AI-generated media comes with metadata baked in (e.g., image EXIF data).

- **Steganography** – Messages can be embedded within the output, only detectable with the right key.

## **The Problem: LLM systems can Fingerprint their Outputs with Unicode Shenanigans**

LLM systems can inject subtle fingerprints into their outputs using Unicode tricks. These can include homoglyphs (characters that look identical but aren't), invisible characters, and other Unicode weirdness--all embedded in AI-generated text for later detection.

If AI-generated text is secretly marked, your emails, reports, or even tweets might be screaming \"AI-generated\" without you realizing it--though a filter might.

## **How do I remove this: `sanitext`**

`sanitext` is a simple command-line tool and Python library that:

✔ **Detects** suspicious Unicode characters (defaults to ASCII-only)  
✔ **Normalizes** lookalike characters to ASCII equivalents  
✔ **Removes** characters with no lookalikes  
✔ **Supports** custom character allowlists (`--allow-chars`, `--allow-file`)  
✔ **Works with your clipboard**-no manual pasting needed (unless you want to)

## **How It Works**

`sanitext` cleans up funky Unicode text using **Unicode normalization (NFKC)**, **homoglyph mapping**, and a **special cleanup process**: if not a [known homoglyph](https://github.com/panispani/sanitext/blob/main/sanitext/homoglyph_map.py), decompose the Unicode character and check for ASCII characters in the decomposition, e.g., `ﬁ` (U+FB01) decomposes to `f` + `i`.

It also **flags suspicious characters** so you can see exactly what's causing trouble. You can also allow specific Unicode characters or single-codepoint emojis.

### **🚀 Install in Seconds**

```bash
pip install sanitext
```

Now you can use it straight from the command line.

## CLI usage example

```bash
# Process the clipboard content & copy back to clipboard
sanitext
# Detect characters but don't modify
sanitext --detect
# Process clipboard + show detected characters (most common command)
sanitext -v
# Process clipboard + show input, detected characters & output
sanitext -vv
# Process the provided string and print it
sanitext --string "Héllø, 𝒲𝑜𝓇𝓁𝒹!"
# Allow additional characters (for now, only single unicode code point characters)
sanitext --allow-chars "αøñç"
# Allow characters from a file
sanitext --allow-file allowed_chars.txt
# Allow single code point emoji
sanitext --allow-emoji
# Prompt user for handling disallowed characters
# y (Yes) -> keep it
# n (No) -> remove it
# r (Replace) -> provide a replacement character
sanitext --interactive
# Allow emojis
sanitext --allow-emoji
```

## Python library usage example

```python
from sanitext.text_sanitization import (
    sanitize_text,
    detect_suspicious_characters,
    get_allowed_characters,
)

text = "“2×3 – 4 = 5”😎󠅒󠅟󠅣󠅣"

# Detect suspicious characters
suspicious_characters = detect_suspicious_characters(text)
print(f"Suspicious characters: {suspicious_characters}")
# [('“', 'LEFT DOUBLE QUOTATION MARK'), ('×', 'MULTIPLICATION SIGN'), ('–', 'EN DASH'), ('”', 'RIGHT DOUBLE QUOTATION MARK')]

# Sanitize text to all ASCII
sanitized_text = sanitize_text(text)
print(f"Sanitized text: {sanitized_text}")  # "2x3 - 4 = 5"
# Allow the multiplication sign
allowed_characters = get_allowed_characters()
allowed_characters.add("×")
sanitized_text = sanitize_text(text, allowed_characters=allowed_characters)
print(f"Sanitized text: {sanitized_text}")  # "2×3 - 4 = 5"
# Allow the emoji (but clean it from the encoded message "boss")
allowed_characters = get_allowed_characters(allow_emoji=True)
sanitized_text = sanitize_text(text, allowed_characters=allowed_characters)
print(f"Sanitized text: {sanitized_text}")  # "2x3 - 4 = 5"😎
```
